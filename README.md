## **How It's Made:**

---

### I began the project by creating a create-next-app, installing TailwindCSS, and then configuring custom settings for Tailwind in the config file. I built out some of the simple parts of the website first such as the navbar and a basic card element to test the connection to the Stripe backend. I used a handler function to pull in the Stripe API and display products and checkout IDs to match. I set up the different routes for checkout success/failure and made sure the products were displaying correctly. After that point where the main functionality of the store was working, I began styling the home page first, and the products, about, and contact pages afterward.
